# Security
Simple encryption and decryption in Go. No external libraries.
> Small disclaimer: encryption uses the bitwise operator on bytes. Not extremely secure. See [TODO](#TODO).

## Features
- Encypt/decrypt text
- Encrypt/decrypt single files
- Encrypt/decrypt folders
- Encrypt/decrypt subfolders in folder
- Overwrite files
- Encrypt/decrypt to new folder
- Save new files with prefix
- Save new files with original name in new folder

## Getting Started
To start, you can run the program directly or build it into an executable.
>- **Option 1:** Run the program
```shell
$ go run main.go
```
>- **Option 2:** Build the program
```shell
$ go build main.go
$ main.exe (Windows)
$ ./main (Linux and MacOS)
```
Once the program is running, everything is self-explanatory and intuitive.

## TODO
- [ ] New, more secure cipher for encyption
